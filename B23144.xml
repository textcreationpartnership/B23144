            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:204660:3"/>thee; and dust is the Serpents meat, you must all see it in your selves, whatsoever is seen, is dust; all your out-side Profession is dust, which you have got out of Books and Sermons, and your <hi>Lattine, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and all which is out-ward, is dust; and all your glorious Gospel-notions are dust, and all your Gould and Silver is dust, and fine Apparel is dust, and all the Worlds Glory the mind feedeth on is dust, and all the Worlds Profession and Worships which is not in Spirit and Truth is dust; if the Head of the Serpent be bruised in thee by the Seed of the Woman, thou wilt see these to be so; for the pure Worship is not without, but within, the Worlds Church is without them, carnal Lime and Stone, and their Call is an outward carnal Bell, and a carnal man speaking the carnal Letter, to carnal minds for carnal Money and carnal Ends.</p>
               <p>The Saints Church is in God, and the Father of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</p>
               <p>The Worlds Assembly is without them; a company of earthly minds met in a Steeple-house.</p>
               <p>The Saints are brought <hi>to the General Assembly of the first-born, and to the innumerable company of Angels, and to the Spirits of Just Men made perfest, and to God the Judge of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Worlds Teachers are of the Letter, without, a proud Man called of men <hi>Master,</hi> and hath the chiefest places in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, going in long Robes, loving greeting in the Market, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Rooms at Feasts, all which Christ forbad.</p>
               <p>The Saints Teacher is within them; <hi>Ye need not that any man teach you, but as the Anointing that ye have received teacheth you of all things, and is true, and is no lie; and even as it hath taught you, still abide in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Worlds Law is without them, in the command of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and they break the Commands, and so it is Death.</p>
               <p>The Saints Law is within them, written in their hearts, and they are taught of God, from the greatest to the least; and shall no more teach every one his Neighbour saying, <hi>Know the Lord;</hi> for they shall know him.</p>
               <p>The Worlds Light is without them: A Chapter, or a Verse, which was another mans Light, left upon Record.</p>
               <p>The Saints Light is within them; <hi>You have a Light which shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in a dark place, to which you do well to take heed, until the Day
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:204660:3"/>dawn, and the Day-star arise in your hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Worlds Word is without them, and they take the Letter for the Word, when as the Word is invisible.</p>
               <p>The Saints Word is within them; <hi>The Word is nigh thee, in thy heart and in thy mouth,</hi> and doth sanctifie them, and is sharper than a two-edged Sword, dividing asunder; and is a descerner of the thoughts, and intents of the heart.</p>
               <p>The Worlds Witness is without them, which is the Letter, and it bears witness against all the Practises of the World.</p>
               <p>The Saints Witness is within them; <hi>He that believeth hath the Witness in himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Worlds Baptism is without them, Sprinkling of Infants, for which is no Command or Example in Scripture.</p>
               <p>The Saints Baptism is within; <hi>Baptized with one Spirit into one Body, and are made all to drink into one Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Worlds Communion is without them, taking a Letter-Bread and Wine, which is Carnal, and calls that a Communion, but are separated in Spirit, and are not of one heart and one mind.</p>
               <p>The Saints Communion is within, in Spirit, written in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hearts, and though absent in the Flesh, yet are they present in Spirit.</p>
               <p>The Worlds Touch-stone is without them, and they try the living by the dead, the Spirit by the Letter.</p>
               <p>The Saints Touch-stone is within, whereby they <hi>try the Spirits whether they be of God or no; Every spirit that confesseth Jesus Christ come in the flesh is of God, and he that confesseth him in truth, hath him and the Father also.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The World is ruled by outward Rules, and all goeth from the Rule.</p>
               <p>The Saints Rule is within them; Christ who ruleth over them is the Head of the Body.</p>
               <p>The Worlds Record is without them.</p>
               <p>The Saints Record is within them; the Spirit which God hath given unto them is their Record.</p>
               <p>The Worlds Sabbath is without them, and they have no Rest but in a Form without.</p>
               <p>The Saints Sabbath is within, where Christ is come to give them Rest, and they are saved from their own works.</p>
               <p>The Worlds Psalms are without them, and they sing <hi>Davids</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:204660:4"/>quakings and tremblings, wastings, prophesies, prayers and tears, weeping until his Eyes grew dim; he watered his Couch with his tears. And they tune these into Meeter, and say, <hi>Let us sing to the praise and glory of God,</hi> when it is all to his dishonour.</p>
               <p>The Saints Psalms are within, and <hi>they sing with the Spirit and with the understanding also.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Worlds guide is without them, in the Traditions and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of men, which lead from God.</p>
               <p>The Saints Guide is within them, the Spirit; and they are the Sons of God who are guided by the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>The Worlds Temple is without them, which was builded for the Idolatrous Worship.</p>
               <p>The Saints Temple is within: <hi>Ye are the Temple of the living God, and he doth walk in them and dwell in them;</hi> and they know and can witness God dwelling in them.</p>
               <p>The Worlds Prayers are without them, and the Power thereof stands in outward words, and <hi>they ask and have not, because they ask amiss, that they may spend it upon their Lusts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Saints Prayers are within, by the Spirit which teacheth in all conditions what to pray for, <hi>and helps the infirmities, with sighs and groans which cannot be uttered, and they ask in the Name of the Son and are heard in whatsoever they ask, and thereby is the Father glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, for they ask in Faith, nothing wavering.</hi>

               <p>All you that read these things, read your selves, where you are, whether you are within among the Saints, or without among the World.</p>

But are such as <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> 2, 3. speakes of, which use your tongues and say <hi>The Lord saith;</hi> When the Lord never speake to you. So you have not known the keeping of silence before the speaking; but are such as say, <hi>Your Tongues are your own, you ought to speake; as David speakes Psal.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>So hear what <hi>Isaiah</hi> saith, <hi>Sit thou in silence, get thou in darkeness, O daughter of Caldea: thou shalt no more be called the Lady of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.

But the Lord will put you to silence and you must witness silence before you come to speake: for, <hi>when the divel was cast forth, the dumb speak.

               <p>Now all you lying Lipps that spake contemptuous things against the Righteous you are to be put to silence before you speak, <hi>Psal.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Kir of Moab was brought to silence, because he was in the might, Isa.</hi> 15. And all you who be of <hi>Moahs</hi> stock must know silence though you have had a time to speake, and use your tongues before the time of silence known, and the tongue of the dumb to sing; and, <hi>The Songes of the Temple shall be turned into howling, saith the Lord; and there shall Remain Dead bodys in every place, and they shall cast them forth with silence.

               <p>And the Apostle saith, <hi>Let the woman Learn in silence with

               <p>Now here is a birth Born of the flesh, and this birth born of the flesh will persecute that Birth born of the Spirit. Now come all to know the Birth silence, which is born after the flesh, which will persecute: see you Priests if it be not flesh that speakes in you or not.</p>
               <p>You Teachers and Professors which say <hi>you have not the Spirit of God which gave forth the Scriptures,</hi> then you have not the birth they had, so then you have the other birth, the flesh. So you are in the time to keep silent, which <hi>Solomon</hi> speakes of; Else you are them that <hi>Jerimiah</hi> speakes of, that use their tongues though the Lord never spake to them; and you are them that are <hi>swifter to spake then to hear,</hi> contrary to the Apostles doctrine. Such are the lying Prophets that have not the spirit the Apostles were in, that the Scriptures was given forth from: therfore you have not the birth, that birth and spirit that speakes forth Scripture was come to the time it might speake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So holy men of God spake forth the Scripture as they were moved by the holy Ghost:</hi> and these came to the watching and praying: but, <hi>The Prayers of the wicked are Abomination unto the Lord.</hi> And, <hi>all that watch for Iniquity</hi> shall be cut off, <hi>Isa.</hi> 29.</p>
               <p>And the Apostles were to <hi>wait,</hi> and being Assemled, they were not to depart from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but <hi>wait for the Promise of the Father.</hi> And, <hi>they were to receive Power after that the holy Ghost was come,</hi> and they should be witness unto Christ.</p>
               <p>Now here was a time of waiting, here is a time of speaking: <hi>The hold Ghost fell upon them, that they spake the wonderfull works of God,</hi> 1. Act 1. and 2. And these were them that were gathered together with one accord: So, <hi>where two or three are gathered together in the
<pb facs="tcp:204660:7"/>Name of Christ, he is there in the middest of them.</hi> And Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, the Assembly that were met together, <hi>to wait for the holy Ghost and the Power;</hi> not to debart, <hi>but to wait for the Promise of the Father,</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the Saints were not to forsake the Assembling one another, and to exhort one another inasmuch as they saw the day appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>And what if you should see such an Assembly as was in the dayes of <hi>Ezra: They trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and sate astonished until the evening Sacrifice.</hi> Ezra. 9. And those that come into the true waiting the true assembling; they come to the true supplication and prayer. If you did see some sit down as <hi>Jobs</hi> friends did seven dayes, and speak not a word one to another: this would fret the contrary mind, and make you to wonder, <hi>Job.</hi> 2. But I say, wait on the Lord, and; wait patiently for him: <hi>Fret not thy self because of him that Prospereth in his way, because of the man that bringeth wicked devices to pass,</hi> Psal. 37. The Lord wipes away all tears from all faces and rebuke the People; the Lord hath spoken it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It shall be said in that day, This is the Lord; loe we have waited for him, we will be glad in his Salvation,</hi> Isa. 25. <hi>The Lord is good to him that waiteth for him; and it is good for a man that he should both hope and patiently wait for the Salvation of the Lord. It is good for a man to bear his iniquity in his youth. He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath born it upon him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that which hath acted inniquity, must come in the silence before the just, which comes out of the iniquity, doth come to ruine, and many have the dominion, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. <hi>For the earnest expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Creature waiteth for the manifestation of the Sons of God, and who groans within themselves for the Adoption, to wit the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the Body:</hi> and are come to that condition that they do not know <hi>what they should pray for; but the Spirit maketh intercession with sighs and groans that cannot be uttered: So come to feel him that searcheth the hearts, and knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit: Because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God,</hi> Rom: 8.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Micah,</hi> that cryed out against the Diviners and Teachers for money; said, <hi>He would wait upon the Lord, and he would look upon
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:204660:8"/>the God of his Salvation, and he would hear him.</hi>

                  <hi>Be patient my Brethren for the comming of the Lord Jesus Christ.

               <p>
                  <hi>The end of all things is at hand; be sober, and watch unto prayer,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.</p>
               <p>The Apostes were in <hi>labouring,</hi> and <hi>watchings,</hi> and <hi>fastings:</hi> Now read these, 2 Cor. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And, blessed is he whom when the Lord comes shall find watching; verily he shall make them to gird themselves, and sit down to meat, and will come and serve them. So blessed is that man that heareth and watcheth daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doores,</hi> Prov. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Christ said unto his Disciples, watch therefore, for ye know not neither the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man commeth,</hi> Mat. 25. This speakes Christ concerning the foolish Virgins and wise, such as had Oyl in their Lamps and such as had not: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore look to your selves ye that are fain to go and buy.</p>
               <p>And what think you of them that Christ bid <hi>Tarry here and watch with me:</hi> And Christ comes and finds you asleep, and Christ saith <hi>What could you not watch with me one hour? watch and pray lest you enter into temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Watch therefore saith Christ, for you know not when the Master of the house commeth; lest when he commeth he find you a sleep. And what I say unto one, I say unto all: Watch,</hi> Mark 13.</p>
               <p>Mind where the watching is, and the praying is, they be in the Light, in that which silenceth flesh; for words in that leads from the watch, therefore come to know the watch before every one of your mouths set, and so to keep that silent that must be stopped; and see what Christ said unto all men: <hi>Watch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now all being upon their watch, all are waiting, and hear all shall come to know the Armour against that which will lead aside.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Timothy, he was to watch in all things.</hi> And the Saints were to <hi>watch and be sober unto prayer,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.7. 1 Thes <hi>Let us not sleep as do others, but let us watch and be sober: For they that sleep, sleep in the night, and they that are drunk are drunk in the night: But let us who be of the day, be sober, putting on the brest-place of Faith
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:204660:8"/>and Love, for an helmet the hope of Salvation, for God hath not appointed us for wrath, but to obtain Salvation by our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Saints were to watch, yea, to stand fast in the faith and watch in the same with thanksgiving, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.2 <hi>Continue in prayer and watching with thanksgiving. Remember therefore how thou hast heard and received, and hold fast, and Repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, Ile come on thee as a thief; thou shalt not know what hour Ile come upon thee,</hi> Rev. 3.</p>
               <p>Mark, who are off from their watch, Christ comes on them so; and they that are off from their watch, are out of the Light that comes from Christ. <hi>Watch therefore with all perseverance and supplitation for all Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apostle bids the Saints <hi>watch, Ast</hi> 20. For wolves would comes in among them; but he had coveted on mans silver nor no mans apparrel: but such would enter in after the dayes of the Apostle. <hi>But such as feared the Lord met often together; they spake often one to the other. The secrets of the Lord are with them that fear hint, and such the Lord spares in the day when he makes up his Jewels, as a man spares his onely Son that serves him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And saith the Apostle, <hi>Build up your selves in the most holy Faith, praying in the holy Ghost.</hi> Mark, the building up in that which is holy, in the holy Faith, and a praying in the holy Ghost; now he speaks of some that speak high words, but themselves live in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, and was gone in the wayes of <hi>Balaam</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> and are they that must know a time of silence; for such build not among the Saints, For they are <hi>Babylons</hi> Stones. So all these high speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which speak the high words of the Scriptures, out of the holy Ghost that gave them forth, they be out of that in which the Saints were. And so they that pray out of that are abomination; they are to be silent; and they that be out of the Faith, they be out of that the Saints built up one another in, the <hi>holy Faith.</hi> That which is holy gives Victory, for in that the Saints built, in that they pleased God; So in the Faith, in the Unity, for it gives Victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Enmity and the impure; For it purifies the heart, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it man cannot please God, neither can they build in the Unity, but in the Faith that gives the Victory, in which is the Unity, which is the gift of God, by which he pleaseth him, that praying is in the holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures were given forth from the holy Ghost; <hi>Stephen</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:204660:9"/>a man full of the holy Ghost, in his Examination, when he spake to the Counsel, he said, <hi>They resisted the holy Ghost as their Fathers did,</hi> They professed the Scriptures, and yet themselves resisted the holy Chost.</p>
               <p>So all them that have the Scriptures, and resist the holy Ghost, resist that which gave forth Scripture, and their gathering and their praying are an abomination, and their gathering is to be scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
               <p>Therefore all Friends that are come to witness the holy Ghost, and Faith, in which the true praying is, io which the true building is, which gives Victory over the World, which is the Gift of God, in which you please God. Keep your Meetings. Met together, as you are moved speak; <hi>For they spake as they were moved by the holy Ghost, and as the Spirit gave them utterance. And they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Spirit,</hi> and it <hi>helped their infirmities: For they could not tell what to pray for as they ought; but he that searched the heart, knew the mind of the Spirit:</hi> That teacheth to pray, and here comes to be the new Birth, born of the Spirit, which God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Spirits hears, which is not that Birth which is born after the flesh, but is with that persecuted.</p>
               <p>Now you may see the just man <hi>Simion,</hi> who waited for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation of <hi>Israel,</hi> it was revealed to him, he came to see it: And the People that gladly received Christ, for they all waited for him, <hi>Luke</hi>

               <p>Now that which is not silent would not wait upon Jesus, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute that Birth, but the Birth is brought forth, and the Light springs; it's known, and seen, that must speak, and that is known that must keep silence.</p>
               <p>Praises there ariseth to the Lord God for ever, who is exalting the Birth born of the Spirit, who is feeding upon the Bread of Life, who is manifested with the Light in the Bosom of the Lord God of Life; and the Elder is become servant to the Younger: The arm of God reigns above the Elder in his Kingdom and Throne, and God hath fulfilled his Promise, and is fulfilling it; and a time to speak is known, and a time to keep silence. They that are not come to distinguish each Birth and each Mouth, they do not know the time of Silence and the time of Speaking: Such are judged for judging the things of God, and are not fit to judge.</p>

               <p>The whole world are now stumbling at the Light, who have been checked with it, and convinced, but now are turned from it: So there stands all the world giving names one to another, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dirt one at another, where the enmity is, and fighting one with another, with weapons that are carnal, and waring one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and they that do so mock one another: here is the generation of mockers out of the Life, out of the Light, and every one striving for Mastery, and Lordship, and Authority, one over another but it shall not be so with you, who are Children of Light, Disciples of Christ, not of this world, whose kingdom is not of this world: who comes out of strife comes into peace.</p>
               <p>Therefore all people dwell in that which leads into all peace, and out of confusion, for God is not the author of that, but such be out of the Life holding the Truth in unrighteousness, come out of the bustlings you that are bustling &amp; in strife one against another, whose spirits are not quieted, but are fighting with words, whose hearts
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:204660:10"/>burn against each other with a mad blind zeal, who are up in your wantonness, lightness, &amp; pleasures, who set the whole course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on fire: among whom the way of peace, &amp; that which is perfect is not known; who have the words of Christ, the Apostles and Prophets, &amp; the scriptures of truth, who hold it in unrighteousness where all spirits be disquieted, &amp; the elements come to burn like fire</p>
               <p>VVhere is all the masteries, seeking for earthly Crowns, exalting among the people, and gathering parties out of people, wherein stands the several ways &amp; distance of people one from another, and opinions, and sects, wherein all come to throw dirt one at another, wherein is the weariness, groanes, burdens, travels, &amp; persecuting the just, quenching the spirit, despising prophesying, destroying the meek of the earth, &amp; helpless, &amp; routing of the Innocence, &amp; Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and destroying it; where enters, heats and fire, storms and the many Waters, and the Sea, and the Earth, the Dragon and the Beast, and the false Prophets which were the Wonder in Heaven, cast down into the Earth, which makes war against the Saints and the Lamb; but over all the Lamb hath got the Victory, &amp; that which drank the Cup of Fornication, is she that gives the Cup of Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is that which draws all people from the Life within them.</p>
               <p>So their is the unquiet spirit in the World, and the restless and the wearied; for there is none upon the Earth come to have their spirits quieted, but who come to the Light Christ Jesus hath enlightened withal: And so here come every spirit to have a particular satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and quietness in his own mind, and hear comes the weary to have rest in Christ, who hath enlightened them; and hear is no one but he holds the Truth in unrighteousness, but who comes to that of God manifest in him, and so that of God manifest in him leads his mind up to God, he comes to the peaceable quiet Life, and comes to retain God in his Knowledge, &amp; his spirit is quieted, and he comes to hold the Truth in Righteousness, and his mind is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated, and such a one shall find mercy of God, when their minds are girded up unto God, and their spirits and minds are quieted in silent waiting upon God, in one half hour is more peace and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction than they have had from all other Teachers of the World all their life time, &amp; hear comes every one to feel that which quiets their minds to God, and they find and feel the way of peace, and comes to grow up in that Life the Scriptures were given forth from, and the Life the Saints lived in; and Spirit which guided their
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:204660:10"/>minds up to God the Father of spirits; whereby every particular comes to a particular satisfaction, and all this busling teaching in the World for earthly things, Men and People shall turn from it; for that is in the earth, it is that which went in <hi>Korahs</hi> way, and <hi>Cains</hi> way, and <hi>Balaams</hi> way, which is now standing in the way, which the Apostles saw before their decease.</p>
               <p>So as you all come to be guided by that of God in you, and to feel that of God in you to guide your minds up to God, you shall come to satisfaction; it leads you out of the Earth to that within, so from all those without. And hear comes <hi>the Glory of the Lord God to be revealed in you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though you may profess all the Scriptures of Truth, yet if every particular of you do not come to feel that of God which God hath manifested in you, and shewed to you, to guide your minds to God, you cannot know any of the Scriptures, for that opens the words to every particular, and gives to every particular a particular satisfaction, by which every one comes to <hi>Pray in the Spirit, and Sing in the Spirit,</hi> from which, glory is given to God.</p>
               <p>Now there is no People upon the Earth, com from the first <hi>Adams</hi> State, in the Earth drove from God, in sin, in death, and unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, to the second <hi>Adams</hi> State, but who come into the Light, <hi>that enlightneth every one that cometh into the World,</hi> they that will not come to the second <hi>Adam</hi> from the first <hi>Adam,</hi> they <hi>will not come to the Lord from Heaven, who is the way to the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So ye that are not come to the Light, <hi>which enlighteneth every one that cometh into the world,</hi> they are in the first State, drove from God from his Righteousness, his Wisdom, Truth, Light, and Life.</p>
               <p>So Christ the Light, <hi>which doth enlighten every one that cometh into the world, is the way to the Father; the Truth, the Life, the Light,</hi> Gods <hi>Wisdom,</hi> Gods <hi>Righteousness, the Hope of Glory, and the Power of God;</hi> the <hi>Redemption,</hi> the <hi>Teacher</hi> &amp; the <hi>Saviour,</hi> who doth <hi>enlighten every man that cometh into the world; who is the way to the Father;</hi> which all the world de spiseth. And the teaching of the People which is from the Light, <hi>which enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world,</hi> &amp; doth not own that, they be out of Gods Wisdom, in the Devilish that is before, and are carthly and sensual.</p>
               <p>So this is the State drove from God, Gods Wisdom brings to God and all they upon the earth that deny the Light, that <hi>enlighteneth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man that cometh into the world,</hi> they are yet in the Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in the first <hi>Adam,</hi> they are in their own Righteousness, for any
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:204660:11"/>Righteousness that is not in the Light, is their own; for Christ the Light is Gods Righteousness: so every one that cometh into the world, being enlightened, which heard not the Light which doth enlighten him, he heard not the Prophet whith <hi>Moses</hi> Prophesied of So the Light condemns him, &amp; <hi>he is to be cut off from among the people</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so all the world from <hi>Christ the Light,</hi> from that of God in them, some in the presumption, some in the envy, that eats them out, &amp; slays them, in the false joy of Presumption <hi>mount up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, &amp; fall down to the earth again;</hi> There is all the mind unstablish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the world, they go from that of God in them, which doth not change: the Truth doth not change, which comprehends the world, fathoms the world, the <hi>Light that enlighteneth every one that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the world,</hi> though he hate it, is his condemnation. And you Teachers that profess your selves so to be, give over seting people at enmity one against another, give over your rayling, babling &amp; back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting all People in the Pulpits; for that is not to Preach the word of God: <hi>what you have sown that must you reap,</hi> and gather into your Barns &amp; Treasure. The Lord God sees what stock you be off, who is come to Judgement to Judge the great whore, which is adulterous from him, and his Judgement is now set, and she hath sate upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Waters, and Rivers, and Tongues, and People, and Languages.</p>
               <p>Now all People come to know Christ your Teacher who saith <hi>Learn of me; I am the way to the Father.</hi> So the <hi>Light that enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneth every one that cometh into the World, is the New and Living Way.</hi> So you that be come to the Light you be enlightened withall, you be come to that which is New and Living now as ever it was; therefore all people come to know the <hi>Light in you, shining in your hearts, to give you that knowledge of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</hi> And all people come to know the Heavenly Treasure in the earthen Vessels, which none do but them that come to the Light, which Christ hath enlightned them withall: and all people come to know the second <hi>Adam, the Lord from Heaven,</hi> above the first <hi>Adam, who doth enlighten every man that cometh into the World.</hi> None know him but who own the light, which brings them out of the first <hi>Adams</hi> state, out of the <hi>Earthly</hi> into the <hi>Heavenly.</hi> And all People come to know Gods Word in your hearts, there to obey it, and mind to do it; <hi>This is the Word of Faith preached.</hi> The Ministers of the Letter may keep you reading the Letter without, and telling you the Letter without, but they cannot endure who owns the <hi>Light</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:204660:11"/>talking of the VVord within them in the heart, for feeling Gods VVord in the heart to obey it, you come to know that which the Prophets and Apostles witnessed, <hi>The Word of Life which became flesh, which is Christ in us,</hi> know him in you all upon Earth, then will ye not be <hi>Reprobates: For if Christ be in you the body is dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of sin: and you are alive to Righteousness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And all people come to know the <hi>New Covenant</hi> that God hath prophesied of by his Prophets, and <hi>Moses</hi> wrot of and the Apostles were witnesses and enjoyers of it, the <hi>Everlasting Covenant:</hi> And knowing the end of the first <hi>Covenant,</hi> know this <hi>Covenant</hi> which is <hi>Everlasting,</hi> the <hi>New Covenant with God and his People for ever. His Law is in their hearts, they need not say one to another, Know the Lord:</hi> that <hi>you</hi> may come to enjoy the thing the Scriptures speak of.</p>
               <p>And all people know the mind of Christ, which none can but who come to the <hi>Light he enlightens them withal: that ye may come to be of one mind, heart and soul.</hi> And all people wait to receive the Spirit of Christ Jesus, which if you have not, you are none of his.</p>
               <p>And all People come to live in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Godliness:</hi> Many have the <hi>Form</hi> but deny the <hi>Power,</hi> and be against them in it that declare it; and so you will come to live in the Gospel: And all people come to the <hi>Light that enlightens every man that comes into the World,</hi> yea come to the <hi>Light</hi> which every one is enlightened withal, that is come into the world, that you may come to the second <hi>Adam</hi> from the first <hi>Adam,</hi> that you may have your sins and transgressions blotted out. And all people come to know the Wisdom which is from above, which is above all Earthly, Sensual and Devilish, which is below. None owns this but who own the <hi>Light which enlightens every one that comes into the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And all people come to know <hi>Christ in you the hope of Glory;</hi> which hope of Glory, <hi>Christ,</hi> destroys the hope of the Hypochrite: which hope purifies as he is pure. Now come to know this Hope, <hi>Christ in you,</hi> distinguished in you from your own hope: which <hi>Hope is a Mystery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And all people come to know the <hi>Annointing</hi> that abides in you, to teach you, and as you continue in that which abides in you, you come to know the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> and none knows the <hi>annoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> abiding in you but who come to know the <hi>Light</hi> Christ hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened them withal: Nor none abide with Christ the Son, but who continues in the Light Christ hath enlightened them withal. Therefore all come to know the <hi>Annointing in you,</hi> that you may
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:204660:12"/>know that which teacheth you to continue with the Son; for God is coming to take off his People from the Teachings of men, and to teach his People himself; and the Lords Children shall be taught of him, and they shall cease from man, whose breath is in his nostrils, and come to know their strength renewed, and come to know the Prophets Life, and the Spirit he was giuded withal.</p>
               <p>And all People come from the Churches, and come to know the <hi>Church in God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is the pillar and ground of Truth, where there is neither spot nor blemish, nor any such thing:</hi> out of all strife and contention of this World, and come to know the power of that World where there is no end.</p>
               <p>And all People, <hi>Be not surfeted with the cares of this Life, neither overcharge your harts with the deceitfulness of Riches,</hi> but mind the power of an endless Life, and cease from all these Teachers which teach for carthly things, for such keep you in the earth, and in sin, and teaches people must be in sin while they be upon the earth: and <hi>so make the Covenant of God of none effect,</hi> and they still in their transgressions, and makes Christs dying in vain, and the one offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of no value, <hi>Which hath perfected for ever all them that are san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and his blood of none effect, which cleanseth from all sin:</hi> and the Ministry of unrighteousness for the Ministry of righteousness is manifested, which lets you see the effects of the blood of Jesus and the Everlasting Offering, which you have made of no effect, to the <hi>Light Christ Jesus hath enlightened you withall,</hi> that with it you may see your selves, and see Christ when he comes, and with it be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from all sin, and come into the Unity one with another, and have the Love of God, and Peace of God shed in your harts, and come out of Strife one with another about words and Forms of things, and janglings about Scripture, but come to that of God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest in you that you may know the Life that gave forth Scripture, the Synagogues, Temple, and Priest that takes Tythes, and are to be denied by all such that witness Christ come, the second Preist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and the Jews Sabath also, for all that uphold these things are the Christians that teach for filthy Lucre, and seek for the fleece, and divine for mony, and bear rule by their meanes, that stand praying in the Synagogues, having the chief places in the Assemblies, and are called of men Masters; for all these the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles cried against, and those that hold them up are to be denied.</p>
               <p>All People upon the earth that come to the knowledge of the true
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:204660:12"/>God, must own the Light of Christ Jesus within them, which Light is but one in all men, and brings into oneness all that believe in it.</p>
               <p>All the worlds Teachers, People and Professors, you are far from silence, and the silent meeting together, and waiting upon the Lord in silence, to hear the <hi>Still Voyce,</hi> and to hear this <hi>Voyce behind them saying, This is the Way, walk in it:</hi> and to have your mindes stayd upon God, and to be guided by God, and to be led with the Spirit of God in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o all Truth, when they do not speak words outwardly, first the Spirit leading, then words from the Spirit; and thus the Spirit is not quenched in Son nor Daughter, in Handmaid nor Servant. The false Teachers, false Prophets, and false Apostles used their Tongues, they got the Form of Godliness, but deny the Power, for which they are to be turned from; Which saith, <hi>The Lord saith it, when the Lord never spake to them, neither stood they in his counsel,</hi> had they, they should have stood silent, and waited upon God: But they that use their tongues and say, <hi>The Lord saith it, when the Lord never spake to them,</hi> they were not silent, which the Lord said should be silent: And likewise them that went in <hi>Cains</hi> way and <hi>Corahs</hi> way, and <hi>Balaams,</hi> that spake the high things in hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, and likewise <hi>promise Liberty, whilst themselves were ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to corruption,</hi> and these cried against those that waited upon God, and these should be silent.</p>
               <p>Therefore now in this Age, they that use their tongues and say, <hi>the Lord saith it when the Lord never spake to them, and have the Form of Godliness but deny the Power,</hi> and speak the high words, but they themselves are in the hipocrisie, in <hi>Cain, Balaam</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahs</hi> way, separated from the Spirit that gave forth the Scriptures, and so from God and the Father of Spirits, Professors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: such are angry and offended at them that in silence wait upon God in his counsel, and patiently wait upon him, whose hearts pant after God when there is never a word spoken, who receive strength and blessing from God, the living mercies, the sure mercies of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi> yea, a harkening diligently, whose soul comes to live, hence is a silent waiting, and a diligent waiting, and a silence in heaven, yea the peace upon earth, and good will towards men witnessed.</p>
               <p>Now they that be exalted above their measures of the Spirit of God manifested in them, such glory in Expressions and Words, and feed upon them more then Life, and delight in Words, Methods, and curiosity in speech, and this is that which is offended at silent
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:204660:13"/>waiting upon God, which looks at high Expressions, and is fuller of them than Life, that feed the birth that must be silent, that is born of the flesh; so there is a time to be silent: This is the Word of the Lord God to you all, that you may all come to that which God doth manifest in you; it will let you see the Birth that must be silent, and bring you to be silent, and to wait to receive teaching from God, then what is said, you may declare from the Lord of Heaven most high. <hi>Cain</hi> was the first birth, and <hi>Esau,</hi> and <hi>Ishma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> were the first birth: Now tell <hi>Cain,</hi> the envious murtherer, of a silent meeting or a waiting upon God, when he is a Vagabond from that of God in him, and so from God, would slay and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them that are in the Life, and yet he will stay and sacrifice, to which sacrifice God hath no respect, who is from Gods Life a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabond, a murtherer, that hath not an habitation in God.</p>
               <p>Here is <hi>Cains</hi> Off-spring and Generation known, so he hath not Eternal Life abiding in him, he envyes his Brother, and how can he know a silent waiting upon God in the Eternal, that hath not the Eternal Life abiding in him?</p>
               <p>Consider this all ye envious ones, this is Gods Word to you all, you are far off from silent meeting and waiting upon God, or of the Love of God that envyes not, or the Body that edifies its self in Love. Do not tell <hi>Esau</hi> of silent Meeting and waiting upon God, that hath despised his Birth-right, and after seeks it with tears, where there is no place found for him: Now tell <hi>Esau</hi> of silent Meeting it is a wonder to him that despiseth his Birth-right, and would sway the sword, and slay his Brother <hi>Jacob,</hi> the second Birth.</p>
               <p>But Silent Meeting is not a strange thing to righteous <hi>Abel,</hi> nor to the second Birth <hi>Jacob,</hi> for God is the Author of their Faith: and <hi>Esau</hi> a cuning hunter, the prophane person, is among the Beasts of the field, that have the fat of the earth, a place for Dragons, that bears the Sword to destroy the Righteous; tell him of Silent Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and waiting upon God, he will hunt until he hath tired himself that he faints again, and despise his Birth-right: And likewise wild <hi>Ishmael,</hi> and the Mother, tell those of silent Meeting, and waiting upon God, nay, this will boast, and scofe, and mock that which brings to wait upon God in <hi>silence;</hi> this is that which is to be cast forth: So <hi>Esau, Cain</hi> and <hi>Ishmael,</hi> you may see your stock
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:204660:13"/>Stock, Off-spring, and Root, and you be the Branches, who be prophane, and envious, and scoffe and mock at them who do silently and patiently wait upon God for Counsel and Instruction, who is the giver of all good; so as they are moved by the Spirit to pray, to praise to give thanks, to speak with the Spirit, as it gives utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as it reveals things, and so it leads and receives from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Spirits, and comes to be obedient. Glory over all to the Highest of Heaven and Earth, that is bringing forth a Birth born of himself, that knows the Father, and declares him, which doth keep other births silent; and all who speak a devination of their own heart and brain, and are the filthy Dreamers, false Prophets, false Teachers, Shepherds, Apostles, and Ministers of unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and such as divine for money, and teach for filthy lucre, and make Merchandize of the People, and seek for their gain from their quarters, and bear Rule by their Means, and Teach for the Flexe, and are called of men <hi>Master,</hi> and stand praying in the Synagogues and have the clief places in the Assembly, which Christ, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles cryed against, who were out of the Spirit; these now cannot endure Silent Meeting together, and waiting upon God; these are full of words and steal them from their neighbours, these mind earthly things, which make Merchandize of the People; and these are Transgressors all of them, for they set up that which the Apostles threw down, <hi>Tythes,</hi> and <hi>Temple,</hi> and <hi>Synagogue,</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi> before mentioned.</p>
               <p>Now these be them that be out of the Life, and these be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at Silent Meetings, and Waiting upon God in silence, and for <hi>Doctrine, teach their own Traditions, Ordinances and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> and neglect the Commands of Christ; telling People of Sprinkling Infants in a Baptize, and a Sacrament, where there is no such Scripture.</p>
               <p>And these will give to the People <hi>Davids</hi> conditions in Metter; his Quakings, Prayings, Roarings, Tears and Prophesie, and so use their tongues with other words, when both Teachers and People are out of <hi>Davids</hi> conditions; and such cannot endure silence; before they will be silent they will sing a ly: <hi>They are not high minded,</hi> they <hi>have no scornful eye. Their bones quake and tremble. They Roar all the day long; their bones fail of fatness, they fast untill they may number their bones, and they cry and weep untill their eyes be sunk
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:204660:14"/>in their heads, and Roar in their Couch</hi> (when it is not so) they are singing in a Steeple-house; and this doth declare that gross darkness hath covered them all, And this is the birth that must be silent, that spakes of <hi>Davids</hi> conditions, without <hi>Davids</hi> Life; or <hi>Davids</hi> Trembling, Quakings and Prophesies, so with <hi>Davids</hi> spirit these are judged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now he that hath a Psalm</hi> (mark now he that hath one) <hi>Let him sing,</hi> and <hi>sing in the Spirit?</hi> and now he that sings in the Spirit, and prayes in the Spirit, <hi>as the Spirit gives him utterance,</hi> he is in that Birth that silenceth the birth of the flesh.</p>
               <p>And this is to all that would learn silent waiting upon the Lord and silent meeting (for none shall ever come to God that is upon the earth) but as they do come to that of God in them, <hi>the Light, which Christ hath enlightned them withall;</hi> and that is it that must guide every ones mind up to God, and to wait upon God, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Spirit from God, and the Spirit leads to wait upon God in silence; to receive from God, as many of the Prophets and holy men of God, they sat often long waiting upon God, and said, <hi>Blessed are all they whose minds are staied upon God, they shall be kept in perfect peace.</hi> And, <hi>My soul wait thou upon God;</hi> and, <hi>the meek inherits the blessing;</hi> and ye shall find more strength, vertue, water of Life, and the mercy of the Lord, and the presence of the Lord God, as you are still kept to that of God in you; when you are still from your own thoughts, and Imaginations, and desires, and counsels of your own hearts, and motions, and wills, when you stand singly from all these, waiting upon the Lord, is strength renewed: He waiting upon the Lord, feels his shephard, and he shall not want. And that which is of God within every one, is that which brings them to wait upon God in every particular, brings them to unity which joynes their hearts together up to God. so as this moves, this is not to be quenched, when it is moved to pray or speak, for there is the power of the Lord, this is the arm of the Lord, the Dominion the victory over death; and all People and Teachers on the earth that hath kept people from the <hi>Light, that doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world,</hi> that which is to be known of God many fest in them, they be them that shut up the kingdom of Heaven from men, that would neither go in themselves nor suffer others; these be them that have taken away the Key of Knowledge from People, that neither they nor the people could get into the

And Christ, Gods Covenant of Peace, of Light with God and man they must come into; then all flesh must be silent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord; so the Light comes to guide, and all you that be in your own Wisdom, and in your own Reason, tell you of silent wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon God, that is famine to you, it is the strange Life to you to come to be silent; you must come into a new World now, that must dye in the silence, dye from the Wisdom, from the Knowledg, from the Reason, and from the Understanding; so as thou comest to feel that which brings thee to wait upon God, thou must dye from the other, that brings thee to feel the Power of an endless Life, and come to possess it, and a silent waiting upon God comes to receive the Wisdom from above, by which all things were made and Created, and it gives an understanding and a reason, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguisheth from the Beast; and the Life of God in thee, which brings to wait upon God which gives thee Life, brings to know God, and to know God is Eternal Life.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:204660:19"/>him and find him, though he be not far from every one of us.</hi> Here the Apostle saw the times, and declared it to the People which held up the Temple, they did not know God; and he denied the Temple which God had commanded; and some of them mocked when they heard him Preach Christ Jesus and his Resurrection, as they mock now which hold up the Temple, which God never commanded, which <hi>Jude</hi> spake of, <hi>Vers.</hi> 18. And the People said unto the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in the 17th, of the <hi>Acts,</hi> when he preached Christ, <hi>That he seemed to be a setter up of some strange Gods;</hi> and called him <hi>a Babler,</hi> and said, <hi>Let us hear what the Babler will say; for he denyed the</hi> Temple which God had commanded, and said, <hi>God did not dwell in Temples made with hands,</hi> as you may read, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.17. What uproares there was then among the Trades-men against the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, and they said so, <hi>That not only this our Craft is set at nought, but also our great Goddess</hi> Diana <hi>like to be set at nought and despised, and their magnificence, whom all the World Worshipped: And when they heard that, they were full of wrath;</hi> they that held up the Temple of their great Goddess <hi>Diana for the space of two houres.</hi> As you may read, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.21. <hi>The People made a shout for their great Goddess Diana.</hi> The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> goes into the Temple, and <hi>when they saw him in the Temple, they stirred up all the People and laid hands on him;</hi> crying out, <hi>Men of Israel help: This is the man that teacheth all men every where and hath brought also these Greekes, into this Temple, and polluted this holy place. And all the City was moved, and they ran together and layd hold on him, and drew him out of the Temple, and the doors were shut; and they went about to kill Paul, and they beat him and when some Souldiers and the chief Captain came, and they saw them, they left beatìng Paul.</hi> And here the men of <hi>Israel</hi> were crying to, which held up the Temple, to help out with <hi>Paul.</hi> And here let all the wise in heart see what was <hi>Paul,</hi> and in going into the Temple to witness forth the second Priest-hood, Christ Jesus; and the Apostle when he wrote his Epistle to them which witnesed the second Priest-hood, Christ Jesus, and denied the Temple, he called it, <hi>the Idol-Temple,</hi> as you may read, <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. to the tenth. <hi>Solomon</hi> built a Temple. <hi>The Lord spake to David, and said, Thy Son shall build a Temple whom I will set up in thy Throne, in my Name.</hi> Then <hi>Solomon</hi> began to set to work the Hewers of Ceaders and Timber, and the Lord gave <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> Wisdom, which he did promise him. <hi>Solomon</hi> had threescore
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:204660:20"/>and ten thousand that did bear burdens, forescore thousand Hewer in the Mountaines, besides the chief of <hi>Solomons</hi> Officers that were over the Work, three thousand and three hundred, which were over them that wrought the work, and many there were at the Building of this Temple; and <hi>Solomon</hi> had a command, which the Lord said <hi>Solomon</hi> should do, as you may read in the 5th: of the first of <hi>Kings,</hi> the Lord said he should build him a House; and when it was built, and Christ a greater then <hi>Solomon</hi> was come, which was the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, yet he went into the Temple to whip out; though it was in their time to be <hi>a House of Prayer:</hi> After Christ Prophesied to his Disciples, and shewed unto them in the 24th: of <hi>Mat.</hi> The destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; and Christ which was greater then <hi>Solomon</hi> Prophesied the destruction of <hi>Solomons</hi> building, for <hi>Stephen</hi> denyed it who witnessed Christ; and the Prophets denyed it, who saw Christs Acts; and the Apostle denyed it which was witness of Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. And the people halled him out of it, and said, <hi>He polluteth the Holy Place,</hi> Acts 21. And the Apostle called it, <hi>The Idols Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and said, <hi>What, know ye not that your Bodies are the Temples of Holy Ghost, which is in you; you are not your own, for you are bought with a price, therefore Glorifie God with your Spirits, which are Gods.</hi> So such as can witness this price, and this Christ, and are bought, doth deny the outward Temple, and their Bodies the Temple of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>

And saith the Scripture, <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.1. <hi>The true Church is in God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ:</hi> So here, let all the honest in heart see how all these falce Prophets have deceived you. <hi>And Christ prophesied and said unto his Disciples, he sent them forth in the midest of Wolves;</hi> and, <hi>he bad then be harmless and wise;</hi> and he told them, <hi>They would scourge them in their Synagogues:</hi> And this he prophesied to them, which we find true, as you may read, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.16, 17. And, they would <hi>hale them before Rulers,</hi> (and as it is said) <hi>yea, and think they do God good service.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was in the first Priest-hood, he <hi>beat in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:204660:20"/>and Imprisoned them that believed in Christ Jesus,</hi> the second Priest-hood, and here <hi>Paul</hi> fulfilled Christs words, as you may read, <hi>Acts</hi> 22. <hi>Paul</hi> was called <hi>Saul</hi> in <hi>vers.</hi> 13</p>
               <p>While <hi>Paul</hi> was in the first Priest-hood he held up the Temple and the Synagogues, but after he was haled out of the Temple he denyed the Temple, as we may read in the Scripture before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Christ being the true Light which enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world,</hi> as you may read <hi>John</hi> 1. (who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied the destruction of the Temple) the Apostle was sent to turn them from darkness to this Light, to believe in Christ Jesus, the second Priest-hood, as you may read, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. how he was sent <hi>to turn them from Darkness to Light, and from the power of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to God; that they might receive the forgiveness of sins, and the inheritance among them that were sanctified by Faith in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Apostles, <hi>which went into the Synagogues of the Jews, stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up the people, and there was a great assault made by the Jews, and Gentiles, and Rulers to use despightfully and stone them,</hi> as you may read, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>And of the Apostle that preached Christ in the Jews Synagogues the People said, <hi>Is not this he that destroyed once all them that called on his Name? And after many dayes they took counsel to kill him. And they of the Synagogues when they heard Jesus, were filled with wrath, and thrust him out of the City, and brought him to the brow of the Hill, that they might throw him down headlong;</hi> as you may read in <hi>Luke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here you may see the cruelty of them in the Synagogue against Christ, and so likewise against his Apostles, and against his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants now, as their fruits makes manifest. For now we be unto them, who are Painted with Christ and the Apostles words, and are out of their Life found, as you may read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. And all you that take Tythes of the People, and bring the first Priest-hood, and say, they took Tythes, and say <hi>Levy</hi> took Tythes, who came out of the Loynes of <hi>Abraham:</hi> And say, the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> took Tythes; and Christ said, <hi>those things you ought to have done.</hi> But he cryed, <hi>Woe unto you blind guides, which strain at a Gnat,</hi> and did not descern the secod Priesthood, Christ Jesus. And he said, <hi>You ought to have done these things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prophets or the Lord said, <hi>They robbed God of the Tythes who brought them not to the Store-house;</hi> and that was in the first
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:204660:21"/>Priest-hood. For you that say <hi>Abraham</hi> paid Tythes to <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedeck,</hi> yea, I say, he did out of the Spoil, but not out of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
               <p>The Apostle in the 7th. of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> speaks of <hi>Abraham</hi> pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tythes to <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> like unto the <hi>Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Levy</hi> receiving Tythes is the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priest-hood, and they had a Command to take Tythes according to the Law, yea, of their Brethren; and said, <hi>The Law made High Priests.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>The Priesthood was changed, and that there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of the change of the Law; and there was a dissannulling of the Command going before, by which the Priest-hood took Tythes,</hi> Heb. 7.8.</p>
               <p>And when the Apostle had spoken of Tythes in the dayes of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raham,</hi> and Tythes in the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priest-hood, he said, <hi>The Priest-hood was changed, and the Law also,</hi> as you may read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.11, 12. when the Apostle had spoken of those things before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Melchizedeck like unto the Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now of those things that were here spoken, this is the Sum: The High Priest and Tythes was one thing, and the Priest-hood was another thing the Apostle spoke of. And now if you speak of Tythes after the Law, Christ Jesus is the Sum of things.</p>

I am the same Door that ever was, the same Christ; to day, yesterday, and for ever: the Light is the eye that sees it, which Light is Christ, and that Seed passing after Christ out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the house of darkness, from under the Law, the righteousness of the Law is fulfilled in us, who walk not after the Flesh but after the Spirit, as the Apostle saith, which we do witness, and the same Seed passing into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, and there is tempted to lust after the Creature: You that are in the Wilderness witness this with me, and the same tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions even to despair, and make themselves away; for the Divel before he would go out of his Kingdom he would destroy all: But look at the Captain, Jesus Christ, who hath passed before, who was tempted, (the Captain of our Salvation) and the same tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations to worship the Divel, and if thou wilt worship the Divel, thou shalt have the glory of the World, but if thou wilt not bow down and worship the Devil, thou shalt have none of the worlds glory, but be called a Devil as Christ was, and a mad man as he was, and none follow him but a cursed people; Them that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the Devil gave these Titles unto them: And thou shalt lose thy good Name, and be a laughing stock to them that worship the Devil, and a derision among them, and a mark for every one to shoot at, and the drunkards to make Songs of thee; this is the portion of them that deny the worship of the world, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, favour, and fashons thereof; and cannot fashon themselves to it, who are tempted to all these things; but it is no sin to be tempted: For standing in the power of Almighty God, you stand against and above all the wiles of Satan: So dwelling in the power of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, which caries through the Wilderness, and through temptations, and to the end, and gets the victory over all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, Commandments and Traditions of men, and he that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes

               </p>
               <p>Many of the <hi>Jewes</hi> suffered death by the <hi>Heathen,</hi> because they could not Transgress the Commands and Law of God, and suffered because they could not eat Swines flesh; and the Prophets of God. Againe, many of them suffered (by the <hi>Jewes</hi>) who witnessed Christ was to come: there was one slain betwen the Temple and the Alter by the <hi>Jewes,</hi> which had the Words but not the Life; now many of the <hi>Jewes</hi> which had the Words caused others to suffer which had the Life: but the Prophets they suffered for the Life, and the Apostles they suffered for denying of the <hi>Jewes</hi> Commandments and their Ordinances: and said, <hi>Whatsoever they sold in the shambles that they might eat.</hi> And the <hi>Jewes</hi> formerly suffered for holding up these things, before the Substance was come, by them that were out of the Law of God: for the Prophets suffered for many of these outward things, by them who had not the Life, who saw and declared the Substance; and these were for Signs and for Wonders to both the Houses of <hi>Israel:</hi> and while the <hi>Jewes</hi> many of them suffered, their was somthing stiring in them that carried them into obedience to the Command of God; and when the <hi>Jewes</hi> went only into the Word from the Life, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted the Prophets, and killed the Just One and persecuted the Apostles who witnessed the Just One. Now these <hi>Jewes</hi> may say, <hi>What is become of our Forefathers that suffered death for obeying the Commands of God,</hi> these that persecuted the Prophets and put the Son to death, and persecuted the Apostles, these might complain and say, <hi>What is become of all our Fore-fathers?</hi> For that which was in their Fore-fathers, the Life of the Law, which brought them to know the Law, and keep the Commandiments, those lived, and that suffering was excepted: but those that were from the Life, though
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:204660:26"/>they held the outward Commandments, Statutes, and Ordinances, yet they persecuted the Life, Christ Jesus, the Prophets and the Apostles: and here is no talk of their Fore-fathers, or of them that suffered, for here is a distinction between them, for <hi>Abraham, David</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> saw the end of the Patern, which they that had got their words, which might plead, <hi>What is become of our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, or them that had suffered of the Heathen?</hi> Those that were Transgressors, was another state from them which saw through, and saw the end; so they stood not against the Substance, nor the Life, but they did that had the Words and wanted the Life: Those were with the Life of the Prophets, Christ and Apostles Judged as People having <hi>Eyes and see not, Eares and hear not;</hi> Now say you that call your selves Christians, but be out of the Life of Christ and the Apostles, <hi>What is become of our Fore-fathers, and what is become of the Martyrs that suffered?</hi> Alas for you, you are not to be compared to them, that have gotten the Martyrs Words, and Christ and the Apostles Words: as the <hi>Jewes</hi> were not (that suffered death) to be compared to them, they persecuted to death; so you differ from the Martyrs that suffered death, as those that caused death. Neither are you to be numbred with those that suffered for the Righteous Law of God, with those <hi>Jewes</hi> which persecuted Christ to death, and the Apostles and the Prophets; so here now you be in a wrong measure, which is to be short in comparing your selves, and making your selves of that number that suffered; but the true measure makes you of that number that persecuted, and then see what is become of all them, how should they escape Hels Damnation; for the least degree that is Pure, that brings to suffer, is accepted; but that which getteth the Words and causeth to suffer, is for Judgment. So you having gotten the Apostles Words, and Christ Words, and Command; Now the Apostles suffered, and some of them that Lived in the Life, the Believers after them, as the Record of the Scripture doth make manifest; but that being come which the Apostles spoke of, the Substance, you that have the outward Command and Letter, and not the Life, but are standing up prateing of the Words, you are persecuting them, rising up against them that witness the Substance, and the end of the Apostles Words. So you are not to be measured with them that suffered, the Apostles and Martyrs, that are now persecuting them that are Believers. So
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:204660:26"/>it is now as it was then, in this Age as it was in that Age, for formerly there did some suffer, for bearing Testimony to Gods Commandments, Ordinances and Statues, and the Shadows: and when the Substance was come among the <hi>Jewes</hi> that had the Shadows and outward Commands, and the Tipes, them that had thus persecuted the Substance, would not have the Substance to Rule: measurable with you that be called Christians, which now stand against the Substance it self, who hath the outward Form and Command, but will not have Christ in Spirit to Reign as they would not have Him in flesh to Reign, neither would they have Him in flash to Reign, as they would not; but the Substance is come whereby the end of all things is seen, and <hi>Heaven and Earth shaken, and a new Heaven and a new Earth is witnessed, wherin dwelleth Righteousness.</hi>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:204660:30"/>himself, and destroys the Devil, the seed Christ who is the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self, in whom there is no shadow nor variableness, nor changing, who reconciles in one, things in heaven, and things in earth, who destroyes the Devil through death who hath the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of death, so the seed reignes, his flesh the offering is believed in and fed upon, it must be eaten if people have life, which is a mystery as ever to all them that stops their ears, and closes their eyes to the eternal principle of God in them, Christ flesh is a myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to them as it was to the Jewes, for they that stop their ears they hold up outward sacrifices, and slay Christ in themselves, and press him as a cart with sheaves, and such were they that Crucified him without them when he was manifest and apeared in flesh God was in this flesh, he took not upon him the nature of Angels but the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> not the nature of Angels, for he came low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, so all must be of this flesh and bone of Christ if they be of his Church, which he is head of, (mark) of his flesh which shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver corrupt, which neither death nor bonds can hold, but in the determinate and apointed time of God was raised up, now they that are in the belief of this flesh and offering sees over all offerings to the begining into the glory which was with the Father before the World began; for all outward offerings and sacrifices was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to man after he fell, and the Lamb slain, which offering is a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Christ the seed to be brought forth and offered up, and he the top-stone over all laid, to end and finish all the outward offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and typs and shadows, and in him there is none; and also to bring man to the state that he was in before he fell, and not only thither but to himself, the seed; a state that shall never fall, and so in this stands the true belief, so all they that do and doth Crucifie Christ within them, and without them are such as stop their ears to the eternal principle of God in themselves, and close their eyes to it: and secondly all they that to themselves Crucifie Christ afresh, are such as stops their ears and closes their eyes to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal principle of God in them; so greives and quenches, and vexes the Spirit of God in them, and so they form a belief in themselves in the tossed part, and their belief is not in the eternal God, nor in the flesh of Christ the offering, for whose belief is in the flesh of Christ it is in the offering, through which they can see Eternity, and so this belief is born of God, and this is a belief that shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver die, and this is a belief that shall never be condemned, which
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:204660:30"/>comes from death to life, and this is a belief in the onely true God, and in Jesus Christ whom he hath sent which is eternal life, (mark) this belief is in the eternal life, and in this belief here is no shaking, no variableness, no changing, no fading nor altering, but it is that whch overcomes; and here is the new and living way, Christ is known to be the light and the life and the truth, and he that believes hath the witness in himself, and hath the Seal, and can set to his seal that God is true who fulfills all his promises, and types, by the seed, the offering in whom there is no shadow, nor variableness nor turning, nor twining, so through this offering is the reconciliation, through the offering of his flesh, that never cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, but takes away corruptions, and his blood cleanseth from corruptions, the life read. And so this pure flesh this offering is set over all, which never corrupted, which must be your meat if you live, though there is more in all these things which is hard to be uttered and cannot be uttered yet, (mark) there is <hi>Adams</hi> flesh defiled, whom Christ sanctifies and cleanseth, and perfecteth by his offering, and cleanseth by his blood, for as much as children were pertakers of flesh and blood, he also took part of the same; so all Christendome hath talkt long enough of Christ flesh and blood, now had they all eaten his flesh and drunken his blood, then they had all had life in the Son of God, and then had they been feeding in the pasture of life, and then they had had all peace in him; but Christendome hath talked about the flesh and blood of Christ so long, that now they can hardly hear one another talk of it, they are so envious: But this is the word of the Lord to them all, they must eat his flesh and drink his blood if they live and have life in Christ, and had they done all so they had been quiet in Christ, from whence they have life, so now the belief lies in the offering Christ Jesus, and there is a passing through Christs flesh, and a eating of his flesh, and a becoming of his flesh and his bone, and so through him they have life eternal, and through him they believe in God.</p>

               <head>A LETTER to all FRIENDS.</head>
               <p>FRiends to you all, this is the Word of the Lord: Take heed of Judging one another; Judge not one another. I command you in the presence of the Lord, Judge not with that which must be Judged; and Judge not one another behind one anothers backe, I command you in the presence of the Lord. This is the Word of the Lord unto you; neither lay open one anothers nakedness, and weaknes behind one anothers backs, for thou that dost, art one of <hi>Hams</hi> family, which is under the Curse; but every one in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, with the Light of Christ, which he hath inlightened you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, to see your selves with it, every one see with the Light, every one Judge self, that self may be Judged out with the Light in every one; and so to you all, this is the Word of the Lord. And that there be no backbiting behind one anothers backs, but in love. You that dwell in the Light, and see clear, spake to the other, whose minds are gone from the Light; if you, as I said before, spake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind their backs there will be the evill Eye and filthy mind, which dares not spake to the face, and so the same that doth condemn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the back, is for condemnation with the Light, so self shall be
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:204660:31"/>Judged first. So here you may be pure in the fear and love of God and watchful, and all self Judged out from among you, which would be Judging in secret, which is a work of darkness; and take heed, I charge you in the presence of the Lord, of a fained humilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a fained love which is out of the Light, and then that to use as a customary salvation or a form of gesture, which is all for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, with the Light to be keept, which is of the covenant. So see that all your actings be from the Light, and in the Light; here you are all kept pure and clean and will come to be seal d in the Everlasting Covenant of God, with the Light which is from Christ; and again, I charge you in the presence of the Living God, not to suffer thy mind to go out, to contend with them that be not of the Tru h, which are out of the Truth, which both are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with the Truth; for the same mind will boast and get up, which is out of the Truth: which sees things in the comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but that is excluded out of the Truth, and shall not enter, but is for condemnation. And so to you all this is the Word of the Lord God of Power and of Beauty; that in the peace you may be preserved to wait for the Spirit of Grace and Wisdom and the Spirit of Understanding. And Friends all, every where met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, waiting upon the Lord, that your minds may be guided by the Light of God, up to God and know the Life of God in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which all those minds which are abroad are strangers from the Life of God, so you are strangers to the Covenant of Promise; for the Covenant and Promise of Life is with the seed and there is no sin, nor iniquity, nor transgression in the Covenant, for it is all Judged without the Covenant of God, and the Covenant of Life, and so wait I charge you all in the presence of the Living Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God of Life, that you may witness the Everlasting Covenant of Life, dwelling with your souls; and find the witness and find the Seal that you are Sealed to God with; his Seal. That you may all witness sin and transgression finished, and it bloted out; and the new Covenant of God witnesed, with which you may all come to know the Lord, to love the Light, which Christ hath given you, and it to teach you; you will witness the Covenant Christ Jesus; for as the Lord said, <hi>I will give Him for a Covenant; a Light to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles to open the Eyes of the blind.</hi> And so this Light doth open the Eye of the blind, all you that were blind as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> or the <hi>Jewes</hi> which knoweth the Light, your Eyes are opened, and you do see
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:204660:32"/>the new Covenant, the unchangable Priest, the unchangable Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; so in that which changeth not, dwell: I charge you all in the presence of the Living God who changeth not, that that which is changable, and changeth, may be Judged, and condemned, with that which changeth not, though the ministration of condemnation be glorious in its time, which is for condemnation, with that which changeth not, the ministration of the Spirit exceeds in glory, which changeth not and there is no condemnation to them who are here and walketh in the Spirit, and are in Christ Jesus the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: I say there is no condemnation to such, but freedom. But who are in that which changeth, runs in the changable works with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out in that nature which hates the Light, and is all for condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Light that is Eternall and never changeth: And all beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly Lusts, Traditions and Rudiments of men, which is acted in that nature contrary to the Light, is for condemnation with the Light. So dwelling all in the Light, which is not changable, nor changeth, you come to Judge all changable things that can alter and change, and that which comes from God, which changeth not, and with his Light all things is Judged which changeth: with his Light, which he hath given. So dwelling here, in the Light, to Judge all changable things, and keep them out of house and mind. So dwelling in the Judgment, you will be filled full of mercy: first Judgment, and then mercy. To you all, this is the Word of the Lord to spread over all, that the Just may spread over all, and grow up to be King. I charge you in the presence of the Lord God, to send this among all Friends and Brethren every where, to be read in all meetings: to you all this is the Word of God, and to that of God in you all I spake. Friends, I charge you all in the presence of the Living God, evil communication, and evil words, let none pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed out of your mouthes, for though you do find the Root in you, not taken away, that would act, dwel in the Light, which lets you see evil communication, and with the Light to give Judgment upon it in the particular, first to Judge it all: therfore that is it that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts the good manners, and there is no good manners, but all is corrupted whilst there is evil communications: and all your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession is Abomination to the Lord whilst that stands. So <hi>put away all filthy communication out of your mouthes, and all wrath, and all unrighteousness, and all ungodlyness:</hi> With the Light you see it, all walking in the Light, and loving it, you may Judge all with the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:204660:32"/>Light, that you may know the good manners. I charge you all in the presence of the Living God, in the Light to walk, to keep out all the evil communication from among you; for the corrupt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners is there, and proceeds from that; and all the profession which is acted in that nature, while the evil communication is standing, is abomination, and is for condemnation; and all their profession is for the fire. So walk all in the Light with which you are enlighted: I charge you all in the presence of the Living God. It will teach you all the good manners, and pure communication, and condem all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt manners and corrupt communication: so to have the mind cleansed of all such, all walking in the Light have the beesome in their hands, and sweep the Land of all corrupt manners: and vain communication; and with the Light all come to be Judged down. So the Light is the Judge and the condemnation, and in the Light walk, and ye will shine. My deare Brethren in the Covenant of Life, keep to yea and nay, and first day, second day, third day, fourth day, and fifth day, as they were given forth. And dear Brethren in the Covenant of Life, the endles Riches you are made pertakers of, and the endles Inheritance you are come to have share of, <hi>Heirs with Christ of the Kingdom that never fadeth away, you that suffer with Christ shall Rejoyce with Christ.</hi> And to you all Friends which are not come up to the Covenant, and cannot witness you are come into it, and Sealed, follow no image makers without the Life guiding, which is Eternal, which will hew down all imaginations and likenesis, and images, and image makers; that the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God the Father of Life may be revealed, the ground of all Truth And Friends, none speak abroad but as you are Eternally moved of God with the Spirit of the Lord, and to that be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as faithful servants, that you may <hi>enter into the joy of your Lord.</hi> And Friends all I warn you and charge you all, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Living God of Heaven and Earth, that there be no keeping of old things in store, in the mind or memory, or heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising or backbiting among you, speaking evil one of another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind your backs, but Judge that out with the Life of God, and dwel in the Life of God, I charge you all in the presence of the Living God, then you all in this Life of God will have unity: and again I charge you all, in the presence of the Living God, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware and not to suffer that to contend in you, which goeth out of the Truth, but let the Truth Judge it out. And I charge you all in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:204660:33"/>the presence of the Living God, to meet altogether every-where, knowing one another in the Spirit, and not in the flesh, and with the Spirit of God wait upon God, the Father of Spirits. And again Friends, I charge you in the presence of the Living God, love not that which is out of the Truth, but all be kept low in that which is pure of God, and comes from God, you may feed upon. And again all Friends every where, dwel in Truth which never changeth, that you may trample on the flesh; that there be no feeding of love but what is pure, which is Eternal, without any mixture or stain: and that all others may be hewen down, and the rest trampled and trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en down, earth to earth, dust to dust. And now that ye may be kept pure in joy, waiting for the Eternal Riches, from the Eternal God: so all to know the Ministry which is from the Spirit, and in it all are one, and with it, all are Judged. I charge you all in the presence of the Living God, take heed of Pride, but with the Just which is Eternal, keep all that down, and Judge it. <hi>Phe Prayers of the Wicked, are Abomination unto the Lord,</hi> and he hears not <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crits,</hi> this is for the service of this day: but the <hi>Prayers of the Righteous</hi> is heard. And this is to go abroad in the World.</p>
